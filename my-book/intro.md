# My journey on AI

This is about my journey on AI. I will try to cover as much ground as possible so that I will be
able to understand the concepts and apply them in real life. I know this is a tough journey but is
something I always wanted to do. And you know that, unless you start you will never be able to
finish it.

So **let's start** and fix some goals. For each goal I will document my journey and the
resources I used to achieve it.

## Goals

- [ ] Read the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning] free online book.
  - Start Date: 2024-01-25
  - End Date: ...
